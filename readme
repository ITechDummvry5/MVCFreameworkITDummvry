 Summary of How It Works
 
1. index.php (Entry Point)
Purpose: This is the first file that runs when someone visits your website.

What it does:

Loads Composer's autoloader (vendor/autoload.php) 

Creates the Application instance 

Defines all routes like / and /contact 

Calls $app->run() to process the request 

2. Application.php (App Engine)
Purpose: The core app manager that ties everything together.

What it does:

Initializes a Request (gets the current URL + HTTP method)

Initializes a Router (handles the registered routes)

When run() is called, it triggers the router to resolve the current route

3. Router.php (Traffic Controller)
Purpose: Matches the current URL to a defined route and runs the matching code.

What it does:

Stores all defined routes in $routes

Checks what the current URL and method are (via Request)

If a match is found, it calls the callback (like your closure)

If no match, returns a 404 Not Found

4. Request.php (Inspector)
Purpose: Understands the current HTTP request (what URL, what method).

What it does:

getPath() gets the URL path without query strings (/contact, not /contact?foo=1)

getMethod() returns the method (GET, POST, etc.) in lowercase
